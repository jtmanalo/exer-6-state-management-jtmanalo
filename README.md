Application Description:
   Implementation of the checkout feature in an e-commerce prototype with a shopping cart and catalog features.

Things I did in the code:
   I added a Checkout dart file for the checkout process. I implemented the checkout button, which will go to another page named Checkout when clicked. If the checkout button in the My Cart page is clicked yet there are no items in the cart, it will output “No items to checkout” and the “Pay Now” button won't be visible. Once the pay now button is clicked, the total will be set to zero, and then it will output a “Payment Successful” prompt at the snackbar.

Challenges I encountered:
    I found this exercise quite easy because of the template from the handout. I think what I found most time-consuming was copying the code from the handout.
